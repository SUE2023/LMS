		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<p id="Description"> Power Session Library
Welcome to Power Session Library!

Power Session Library is an initiative of Power Session, an initiative a residence of Imara Daima. A platform dedicated to personal development, where members gather every Monday from 7:00 AM to 8:15 AM EAT (except on public holidays in Kenya) to network and learn. The main focus is on four key areas: Financial, Physical, Social, and Spiritual well-being, with various topics ranging from business development, character growth, emotional intelligence, and more.

Our library is a curated collection of books authored by members and their extended network, who have led or contributed to different Power Session sessions and activities. These books reflect the wisdom and experiences shared during our weekly meetings, providing valuable insights for personal and professional growth. The library caters for all ages from children to adults.

The library currently offers hardcopy books for borrowing, with plans to introduce softcopy versions soon. A borrowing fee applies to help maintain and expand our collection.
